# geemee

geemee is under construction.

## Overview

FIXME: Write a paragraph about the library/project and highlight its goals.

## Setup

You'll need a local-repo of https://github.com/kovasb/gamma/

To get an interactive development environment run:

    rlwrap lein figwheel

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
